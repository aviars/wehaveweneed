The site will do the following:
 
·         Much like Craig’s List, we have identified the following categories for people to post what is needed and for people to post what they have and are willing to contribute.  At the top, we will ask that only aid agencies, government agencies, and people texting info from Haiti create posts on what is needed.  We can’t filter or control this, but hopefully people will abide by it

 
·         We will also have a separate category for people in Haiti to text names, photos, and descriptions of those who are alive and may not have been able to contact family
