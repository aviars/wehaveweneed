Overview
========

This is the code behind the `We Have We Need <http://wehaveweneed.org>`_ website
and API. We Have We Need is a platform where relief organizations can quickly
post their most urgent needs and have them matched by generous donors during a
time of crisis. The site was built by a group of geeky do-gooders who saw this
as an opportunity to use technology to help bring people and donations together
in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in Haiti.

This code is made available under a BSD-style license (see the `LICENSE` file).
A `mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/wehave_weneed>`_ exists for development discussion.
The code is hosted on `GitHub <http://github.com/wehaveweneed/wehaveweneed>`_.
